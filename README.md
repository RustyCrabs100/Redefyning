# Redefyning
A Game Engine all about Performance and Efficiency

## Why would I use Redefyning for my Games?
Currently, you shouldn't, and couldn't.
This Game Engine is under develop, and isn't even working as a Game Engine.
We're still in the ***VERY*** early parts of Development.
Our code WILL NOT be very performant in this stage, as we're trying to get our game engine to *actually* be usable.

### Why would I want to use Redefyning for my Games once it's entered a usable state?
Redefyning is a Game Engine obsessed with your game's being Performant, Efficient, and Easy to Develop.
We always try to make sure our work is
 1.  as performant as reasonably possible, so that your only bottleneck in performance is of your own doing.
 2.  as efficient as reasonably possible, so that we won't waste any resources that you could use to make your game better.
 3.  as easy to understand as reasonably possible, so that you don't waste any more time then needed to learn how to use this Game Engine.
 4.  following the best practices 
We try to push to towards the path that is best for you, your clients, and us.
